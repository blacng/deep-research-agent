# Plan: Enhanced Synthesis Agent

**Track:** Enhance the research agent's ability to synthesize information from multiple sources more effectively, providing a concise and coherent final report.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Initial Agent

### Phase 1 Goal
Create the foundational structure for a new synthesis agent and a basic evaluation framework.

- [ ] **Task:** Define the data structures for the new `SynthesisAgent-v2`. This includes input from other agents and the expected output format.
- [ ] **Task:** Write failing tests for the initial `SynthesisAgent-v2` structure and its basic functionality (e.g., can it receive data and produce a simple output).
- [ ] **Task:** Implement the basic structure of `SynthesisAgent-v2` to pass the failing tests.
- [ ] **Task:** Create a simple evaluation script that can run a query and save the output of the current and new synthesis agents for comparison.
- [ ] **Task:** Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Foundation & Initial Agent' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Advanced Prompt Engineering & Synthesis Logic

### Phase 2 Goal
Develop and implement the core synthesis logic and prompt for the new agent.

- [ ] **Task:** Write failing tests for the advanced synthesis logic, including handling multiple sources and conflicting information.
- [ ] **Task:** Implement the advanced synthesis logic in `SynthesisAgent-v2` to pass the tests. This will involve significant prompt engineering.
- [ ] **Task:** Refactor the new agent to improve clarity and performance.
- [ ] **Task:** Run the evaluation script with a set of benchmark queries and save the results.
- [ ] **Task:** Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Advanced Prompt Engineering & Synthesis Logic' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Integration and Finalization

### Phase 3 Goal
Integrate the new agent into the main research flow and finalize the track.

- [ ] **Task:** Write failing integration tests to ensure `SynthesisAgent-v2` works correctly within the larger agent orchestration.
- [ ] **Task:** Update the main research orchestrator to use `SynthesisAgent-v2` instead of the old synthesis logic.
- [ ] **Task:** Run the full application and perform manual testing on a variety of queries.
- [ ] **Task:** Update project documentation to reflect the new agent and its capabilities.
- [ ] **Task:** Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Integration and Finalization' (Protocol in workflow.md)
